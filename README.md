# ISAM
[C#] [Database]

An implementation of sequential index in a database, with simple GUI to play around. Application works on predetermined table structure, containing unique key and 3 double values. All operations on a record (ie. find, delete, update) take the key a user inputs in a field in top-left corner, the same which is used together with fields for a, b and c to add a new record.
